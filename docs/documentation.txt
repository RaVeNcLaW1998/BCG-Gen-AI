How It Works

This chatbot is a simple rule-based assistant built in Python. It reads financial data from a CSV file (data.csv) containing metrics for Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple from 2022 to 2025. The chatbot processes predefined natural-language queries and returns relevant insights using pandas for data handling.

The Streamlit app (streamlit_app.py) provides an interactive interface where users can type questions and view responses styled in a conversational format.
